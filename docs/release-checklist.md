## 7) Publish Prep (`vsce`)

  - `vsce package`
- [ ] Inspect generated `.vsix`:
  - install in local VS Code and run smoke checks

## 8) Publish

  - or `vsce publish <major|minor|patch>`
- [ ] Confirm Marketplace listing updates (description, screenshots, version)
- [ ] Tag release in GitHub (`vX.Y.Z`)
- [ ] Announce release with changelog links

## 9) Post-Publish Verification

- [ ] Fresh install test from Marketplace
- [ ] Upgrade test from previous version
- [ ] Core flows verified:

## 10) Current Project-Specific Notes
